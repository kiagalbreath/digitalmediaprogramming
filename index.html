                    <p class="poem-contents">Listening doesn't always mean understanding <br/>
- Listening could mean getting lost in your own thought of tranquility<br/>
- Or even your own devastational whir<br/>
- Listening doesn't have to be with your ears<br/>
- Just the exhaustion of emptiness that outlines your skull;<br/>
- Or even the numbness that conquers every length from spine to external excellence of your mind;<br/>
- Gliding from one emotion to another could be the loudest transaction without making a single clamor;<br/>
- Listening doesn't always mean understanding<br/>
- But the utter perplexity of ones thoughts drowning in the sound of nothingness.<br/>
